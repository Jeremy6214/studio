// This file is effectively unused in a static export where AI is client-side simulated.
// Kept empty to avoid import errors if other files still reference it.
// For a fully static build, this file and the `ai` directory could be removed
// if no other part of the application relies on this specific `ai` object export.
export const ai = {}; // Provide a dummy export
